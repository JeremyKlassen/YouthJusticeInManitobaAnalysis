# YouthJusticeInManitobaAnalysis

This analysis looks at open data from the government of Canada to find insights behind Justice decisions. It was created over the summer of 2022.

The purpose of undertaking this project was to...
  a) Demonstrate ability to work with large and complicated datasets (bigger than what excel can handle such as the 1.9Gb csv used in this analysis).
  b) Demonstrate ability to work with Jupyter Notebooks and Python. 
  c) Demonstrate ability to produce visuals for stakeholders to use.

The datasets used for this are too large to include on github, and so there are links to the sources included in the project's AnalysisOfYouthJusticeInManitoba.ipynb file. 

##### There are PDF and HTML versions of the finished project available in order to view the results without needing to use Jupyter Notebook.

Finally I included a bunch of the graphs as images if there is interest in viewing those.

Enjoy!
